In this assignment we are tasked with solving the bankers algorithms and determining if a state is safe.

To run this you will need any unix based system. You can run the following commands to compile and run.

  c++ bankersAlgorithm.cpp
  ./a.out

The program will read the state from the input.txt file and determine if it is safe.
